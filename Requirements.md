Project Requirements Document: Physics-Based Puzzle Game (Inspired by Crayon Physics)
1. Core Gameplay

    Objective: Guide a ball from a start point to collect all stars in a level using physics-based interactions.

    Player Interaction:

        Draw shapes (rigid surfaces, wheels, ropes, pivots) to influence the ball’s movement.

        Limited "nudge" mechanic (e.g., 3 nudges/level) to push the ball left/right.

        Activate rockets (in specific levels) for propulsion.

    Physics Simulation:

        Realistic gravity, collisions, friction, and momentum.

        Objects respond dynamically to the ball and environment.

2. Physics Mechanics

    Drawn Object Types:

        Rigid Surfaces: Static or dynamic platforms (e.g., closed shapes become wooden planks).

        Wheels: Circular shapes that roll and transfer momentum.

        Ropes/Chains: Drawn as lines; connect objects or swing the ball.

        Pivots: Anchor points (small circles) to create levers or rotating structures.

    Automatic Shape Detection:

        Closed shapes → rigid bodies.

        Lines → ropes if dashed, pivots if small circles.

        Circles → wheels if large, pivots if small.

    Special Objects:

        Rockets: Propel the ball when clicked; limited fuel.

        Moving Obstacles: Conveyor belts, traps, or collapsing platforms.

3. User Interface (UI)

    Drawing Canvas: Freehand drawing with smooth, responsive tools.

    Toolbar:

        Toggle between drawing modes (rigid, wheel, rope, pivot).

        Undo/redo, clear all, and reset ball buttons.

    HUD:

        Stars collected, nudges remaining, timer (optional).

        Visual cues for active tools (e.g., rope icon highlighted).

    Visual Style:

        Hand-drawn, crayon-like aesthetics with textured paper backgrounds.

        Playful animations (e.g., stars twinkling, objects "sketched" into place).

4. Level Design

    Pre-Built Levels:

        50+ levels with escalating complexity (tutorial → expert).

        Introduce mechanics progressively (e.g., wheels in Level 5).

        Environmental hazards: Spikes, moving platforms, wind zones.

    Level Editor:

        Place stars, set start/end points, add obstacles, and define allowed tools.

        Test and publish levels to an online repository.

    Online Playground:

        Share/download user-created levels with ratings and tags (e.g., "Easy," "Creative").

5. Progression & Scoring

    Star System: Collect all stars to unlock subsequent levels.

    Efficiency Scoring:

        Bonus points for fewer drawn objects, faster completion, or minimal nudges.

        Letter grades (e.g., A+ for "elegant" solutions).

    Unlockables:

        New tools (e.g., bouncy materials) or cosmetic skins (e.g., neon crayons).

        Achievements: "Architect" (solve 10 levels with 1 object), "Speedster" (finish under 30s).

6. Technical Requirements

    Physics Engine: Box2D or Matter.js for 2D physics (balance accuracy and performance).

    Platforms: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS (using cross-platform frameworks like Unity).

    Optimization:

        Limit object count per level to prevent lag.

        Simplify collision meshes for hand-drawn shapes (e.g., convex decomposition).

7. Additional Features

    Sandbox Mode: Unlimited tools to experiment with physics (no objectives).

    Replay System: Record and share solutions as animated sketches.

    Accessibility:

        Colorblind mode, adjustable UI scaling.

        Haptic feedback for mobile nudges.

8. Monetization Strategy (Optional)

    Premium Model: One-time purchase (5–5–10) with all features unlocked.

    Free Model:

        Base game free with ads; remove ads via in-app purchase.

        Paid level packs (e.g., "Space Theme" with anti-gravity mechanics).

9. Development Timeline

    Phase 1 (3 months): Prototype core physics, drawing tools, and 10 levels.

    Phase 2 (4 months): Polish UI, implement level editor, and online features.

    Phase 3 (2 months): Beta testing, optimization, and launch.

10. Risks & Mitigation

    Physics Bugs: Rigorous testing with varied object shapes and interactions.

    Performance Issues: Level complexity caps and mobile-specific optimizations.

    Level Design: Ensure puzzles allow multiple solutions via playtesting.
